# Starboards

A starboard is the main feature of this bot. The free version of the bot gives you access to 3 starboards, each with 3 upvote/downvote emojis. If you don't know what a starboard is, see [..](../../ "mention").

See [options.md](options.md "mention") for a list of configurable options and [commands.md](commands.md "mention") for a list of starboard-related commands.

Take a look at the tutorials section for examples of different setups. See [basic-starboard.md](../../tutorials/basic-starboard.md "mention") for a basic starboard setup.
