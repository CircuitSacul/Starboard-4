# Basic Starboard

1. Create a channel call "starboard".
2. Run "/starboards create channel: #starboard name: starboard".

By default, a newly created starboard will require 3 ⭐️ reactions. You can change this, along with many other settings, by using "/starboards edit requirements/behavior/style/embed". See [starboards](../docs/starboards/ "mention") for more info.
