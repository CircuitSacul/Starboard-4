# Terms of Service

I reserve the right to take any action I deem necessary, which may include deleting bot data or blocking you or your server from using Starboard.

Really the only thing I care about will be vulnerabilities (editing other server's settings, accessing data, bypassing limits, etc.). You're welcome to look for vulnerabilities as long as you don't exploit them in the process. If you find any, please report them.
