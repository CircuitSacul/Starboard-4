# 4.7.0

* Uploaded files (excluding embeddable files, such as images) are always listed in the attachments list
* For premium servers, starboard will now upload files up to 25mb in size (up from 8mb)
* Added a new style of "go to message" links, "Mention", which takes advantage of discord's new message link embedding. When the `go-to-message` setting is set to Mention, the link will be put where the channel mention used to be.
* The initial message for forum threads is now considered to belong to the forum channel (not the thread) for the sake of filters. This means that if you have a filter with "not-in-channel: #some-forum-channel", then the starter messages will not be allowed, but other messages within the forum threads will be.
