# 4.0.0

There are a few significant changes with the release of Starboard v4. This is not a complete list of all changes, but just covers the more important ones.

If you see any problems with the v4 release, be sure to let me know in [the support server.](https://discord.gg/3gK8mSA)

## Changes

* `/starboards emojis [set-upvote|set-downvote]` has been moved to `/starboards edit requirements upvote-emojis: <emojis> downvote-emojis: <emojis>`
* `/rank` has been moved to `/stats`, which now shows more information than just the XP you have.
* `/leaderboard` now has an option to show or hide members who've left the server.
* `/random` and `/moststarred` can now search for messages sent by a certain person.

## New Features

* You can now create starboards and autostar channels in more channel types, including threads, forum posts, Text-in-Voice, and forums.
* Starboard posts now embed all images, rather than the first.
* On premium servers, starboard will now include attachments from the original message that couldn't be embedded by uploading them.
