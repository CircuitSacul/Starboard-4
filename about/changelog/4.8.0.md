# 4.8.0

* Fixed list formatting
* Webhooks are now created as soon as you enable the `use-webhook` setting
* Improve the embedder
  * FixTweet embeds are now supported better
  * Videos inside embeds are now treated as attachments. In premium servers, these videos will be uploaded alongside the embed, if they're smaller than 25mb
  * If the original message content was a URL to an image, then the content won't be shown (like discord does)
* Switched documentation to GitBook
